ProjectIrrationalMondriaan
==========================

This project was writen more than 6 years ago as an exploration of what I could do with the Processing.org enviroment.

Since I upgraded to Yosemite a lot of old Processing sketches broke, rather than fixing the problem I wanted to do a complete rewrite (JAVA is dead?).

===========================

This project is a spawn of --> [ProjectIrrationalMondriaan](https://github.com/DeRaafMedia/ProjectIrrationalMondriaan). Where you can read a full description.

(This painting is vision reactive. Viewer needs to use the whole body  to achief movement (crutch down, stretch out, walk a few steps left or right or a combination of these). The movements are responsive but feel "heavy". The ratio user movement painting movement can be set (example: If the viewer moves 10cm the painting moves 1cm (or 10 pixels)). The painting always wants to spring back to it's default position, so if the viewers movement steps outside of the frame (only a small portions of the live video feed is scanned for movement) the painting falls down again. [Example](http://youtu.be/DZleC86hG3E))

Written and only tested with Mac OS X Yosemite, Xcode 6.1 and I used a Nightly Build openFrameworks (wanted to test some new upcoming functionality)
